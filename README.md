## Updates
- Make sure to have the updated version to view my newest features.

- You can find the version number inside the app on the welcome page which can be accessed by clicking on CookiesApp logo on the left hand side.

- When a new version comes out, download and then extract the files to the old version file location and then run `Setup.exe` to update the files automatically once done just use the desktop shortcut to access the application.
